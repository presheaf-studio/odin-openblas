# OpenBLAS Bindings

The API is designed around ILP64. There is the `Blas_Int` type I eventually plan to place on a `#configure` to enable `LP32` functionality. Note that the ILP64 is a different package on the package managers than the basic version.

Provides a complete set of bindings to [OpenBLAS 0.3.30](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/releases/tag/v0.3.30). 

## Status

This library is in the *early* stages of design and should be considered unstable (and likely has errors). Raw bindings were produced with Odin-Bindgen, and subsequently cleaned up.

Files at the top level build okay, but need the design changes noted below. Files in the `_UNTESTED` folder are not yet cleaned up.

## Dependancy

Windows: Download the x64 library, link against the .lib file and include the dll alongside your main application

Linux: `sudo apt install libopenblas64-dev`

Darwin: may need to build openblas from source; could try `brew install openblas --with-ilp64` (unverified)

## Design

Raw bindings are located in `c/` and `f77/`.

All bindings are wrapped in `Matrix($T)` and `Vector($T)` providing a higher level interface than the raw bindings. You may use these, or just the raw bindings.

Reference `LAPACK_FUNCTION_TABLE.md` for a map of function and wrapping types

## Usage

The API requires pre-allocated arrays and separates workspace queries from computation:

```odin
package example

import ob "../openblas"

// Example: Solve a banded linear system using LU factorization
solve_banded_system :: proc() {
    // Problem dimensions
    n := 100      // Matrix size
    kl := 2       // Lower bandwidth
    ku := 3       // Upper bandwidth
    nrhs := 1     // Number of right-hand sides

    // Step 1: Query workspace and result sizes
    ipiv_size := ob.query_result_sizes_solve_banded(n)

    // Step 2: Allocate arrays
    ipiv := make([]ob.Blas_Int, ipiv_size)
    defer delete(ipiv)

    // Step 3: Create banded matrix and right-hand side
    AB := ob.create_banded_matrix(f64, n, n, kl, ku)
    defer ob.destroy_matrix(&AB)

    B := ob.create_matrix(f64, n, nrhs)
    defer ob.destroy_matrix(&B)

    // ... initialize AB and B with the data ...

    // Step 4: Solve the system (AB is overwritten with LU factorization)
    info, ok := ob.solve_banded(&AB, &B, ipiv)
    if !ok {
        fmt.printf("Solve failed with info = %d\n", info)
        return
    }

    // Solution is now in B
}
```

### API Usage Patterns

1. **Query Functions**: Call `query_workspace_*` and `query_result_sizes_*` first to determine workspace and result sizes
2. **Pre-allocation**: Allocate all arrays before calling solve procedures
3. **No Auto-allocation**: Procedures do not allocate memory internally


## Accelerate Compatibility

Mac is usually setup for LP32.. it can use ILP64, but the bindings have a `_64` suffix. We'll need to make a conditional foreign file that does this something along the lines of `USE_ACCERERATE && USE_ILP64{foriegn {...}}`
